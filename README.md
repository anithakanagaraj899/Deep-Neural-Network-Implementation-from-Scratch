# Deep-Neural-Network-Implementation-from-Scratch
This project involves implementing fundamental deep learning algorithms from first principles, without using high-level machine learning libraries for core functionalities. The main focus is on understanding and building logistic regression and shallow neural networks using only basic Python and NumPy functions.

## The project covers:

- Implementation of logistic regression as a single-layer neural network.
- Training, validation, and testing on multiple synthetic datasets.
- Visualization of classification results using 2D and 3D scatter plots.
- Extension to a shallow neural network with one hidden layer.
- Experimentation with different activation functions such as logistic sigmoid and ReLU.
- Performance analysis and comparison between logistic regression and shallow neural networks.

## Features
- Logistic Regression Implementation: Neural network approach with no hidden layers.
- Shallow Neural Network: One hidden layer with configurable nodes and activation functions.
- Dataset Handling: Splitting datasets into training, validation, and test sets (70%/15%/15%).
- Visualization: Scatter plots to visualize classification boundaries and decision functions.
- Performance Evaluation: Reporting accuracy, loss curves, and comparison of model performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plotting and visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive code development and demonstration)
  
## Implementation Highlights
- Logistic regression implemented from scratch using gradient descent.
- Shallow neural network with forward and backward propagation coded manually.
- Use of numpy arrays for efficient vectorized operations.
- Data split handled manually to ensure reproducibility.
- Multiple activation functions supported and compared.
- Detailed comments and explanations throughout the notebook.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
